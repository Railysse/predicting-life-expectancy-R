### What is the project about?

The project was created as a result of a final year university assignment for a module called **Modelling Experiemental Data** in which we covered many Data Science
related topics.

Starting from a dataset containing World Development Indicators (which you can find in this repository), the task was to create a model
that predicts *Life expectancy at birth* for the countries where this information was missing.

This included a series of steps such as:

* Cleaning the data (not shown in the project)
* Preliminary analysis of the dataset
* Dealing with collinearity 
* Finding the best model
* Predicting life expectancy
* BONUS: The relationship between the continent and life expectancy

The results of the analysis come in the form of a PDF file that covers all the topics above. The PDF file has an appendix that contains the **R** code that was used 
for each section.
Moreover, there is also a PowerPoint presentation included, which summarizes all the results into a few easy to understand and less technical slides.

### What tools were used?

The main tool that was used is **R**, along with a few packages such as **mice**, **leaps**, **olsrr**, **corrplot** and more.
